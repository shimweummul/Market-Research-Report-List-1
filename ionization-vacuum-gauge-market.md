<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ionization Vacuum Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Hot Cathode"</li><li>"Cold Cathode"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ionization vacuum gauge market is categorized into two main types: hot cathode and cold cathode. Hot cathode gauges operate by heating a filament to emit electrons, ionizing gas molecules in a vacuum, which allows for pressure measurement. Cold cathode gauges, on the other hand, utilize a cathode that does not require heating and rely on the ionization of gas at lower pressures, providing a broader range of pressure measurement. Both types are essential for precise vacuum applications in various industries.</p></p>
