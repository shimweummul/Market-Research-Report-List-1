<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Aircraft Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Commercial Aircraft Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) market consists of two main types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS involves sensors mounted on each tire that measure and transmit real-time pressure data, ensuring immediate detection of pressure changes. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, relies on existing wheel speed sensors to infer tire pressure based on changes in rotational speed and performance, making it a less direct but often more cost-effective solution. Both systems enhance safety and operational efficiency in aviation.</p></p>
